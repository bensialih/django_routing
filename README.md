# django_routing

Django routing is to test how routing occurs between diffrent services.

We have multiple services of django, routing done to all but on a specific endpoint.

to start we have 2 django applications

- 1 nginx service
- 1 apache service (I am not a big fan of apache as it seems very limited)
- 1 traefik service
